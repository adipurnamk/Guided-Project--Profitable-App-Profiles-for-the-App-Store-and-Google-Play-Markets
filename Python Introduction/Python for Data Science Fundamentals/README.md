# Guided-Project

This was guided project in Python for Data Science: Fundamentals course by dataquest.io
The original solution is [here](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission350Solutions.ipynb).

In this project, we went through a complete data science workflow:

We started by clarifying the goal of our project.
We collected relevant data.
We cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis.
We analyzed the cleaned data.
In the solution notebook, we concluded that taking a very popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store market. The markets are already full of libraries, so we need to add some special features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, a forum where people can discuss the book, etc. You might have reached a different conclusion, which is perfectly fine as long as you managed to build a data-driven argumentation for your recommendation.
