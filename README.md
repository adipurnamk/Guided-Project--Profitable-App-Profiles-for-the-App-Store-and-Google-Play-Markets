# Guided Project: Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets


For this project, we'll pretend we're working as data analysts for a company that builds Android and iOS mobile apps. We make our apps available on Google Play and the App Store.

What will be done in this project is to analyze whether a free application can generate profits or not? The applications analyzed are sourced from the App Store and Google Play. What do we do in this project is a free whether analysis app in Google Play and App Store is profitable.

At the end of the project, we want to make developers understand what types of apps are likely to attract more users.

The original solution is [here](https://github.com/dataquestio/solutions/blob/master/Mission350Solutions.ipynb).

In this project, we went through a complete data science workflow:

We started by clarifying the goal of our project.
We collected relevant data.
We cleaned the data to prepare it for analysis.
We analyzed the cleaned data.
In the solution notebook, we concluded that taking a very popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store market. The markets are already full of libraries, so we need to add some special features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, a forum where people can discuss the book, etc. You might have reached a different conclusion, which is perfectly fine as long as you managed to build a data-driven argumentation for your recommendation.


### Conclusions

In this project, we analyzed data about the App Store and Google Play mobile apps with the goal of recommending an app profile that can be profitable for both markets.
